// Lazy loading in React means loading components only when they are needed, instead of loading everything at once when the app starts.
// This improves performance and reduces the initial load time of your application.


// Without lazy loading, all components are bundled together and downloaded when the app starts â€” even if some are never used right away.
// With lazy loading:
// Only the components needed immediately are loaded first.
// Other components (like UserefTwo) are loaded on-demand.
// Result: Faster initial page load time and better performance.
